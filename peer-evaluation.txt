Peer's repository: https://github.com/tannerbender/03-Text-adventure.git 



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

- I learned it's easy to die in the Game of Thrones universe.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

- It's very clean; the code is very straight forward.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

- I mean, the code itself is fine.  I will say I wasn't aware that you could actually 'win' until I read the readme.  A short print statement could have solved that.  
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?

- There aren't many comments in the code, but it's so straight forward it doesn't necessarily need it.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

- N/a
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

- Yes
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

- Seperate the information more.  It doesn't need to all be in a paragraph; let it take up a few lines.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

- You're code is very clean and easy to follow.
